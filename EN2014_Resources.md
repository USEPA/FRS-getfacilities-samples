USEPA Facility Registry Service Resource Sheet

I. FRS GetFacilities Lookup Service

This versatile REST API allows facility data to be queried and retrieved in a number of ways, for example by specifying alternate IDs, by spatial query and other parameters - and will return a variety of useful data elements, such as other associated IDs and permit numbers, lat/long values, value add attributes such as HUC/WBD.

Documentation on the REST API:  http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/fii/FRS_REST_Services.html

Sample code illustrating use scenarios:  https://github.com/USEPA/FRS-getfacilities-samples

II.  FRS Subfacilities ArcGIS Service

This ArcGIS Map Service provides mapping of subfacility information such as outfall locations and airstacks.  It can be a useful GIS resource for analysis and other purposes.

This map service is located at the following location:

III.  FRS Linkage Application

The FRS team has added capability to open the FRS Linkage Application (FLA) to partner data stewards.  This will open FRS up to allow state, tribal and territorial data stewards to perform comparative analysis of program linkages, data validity and QA, and can provide a variety of useful reports, as well as allowing partner agencies to submit updates and revisions to erroneous and incomplete information.  It can also allow state, tribal and territorial partners to leverage the EPA FRS data stewardship network for high priority data quality initiatives, such as emergency response.

Interested partner agencies are encouraged to register for access to the FLA and collaborate with their EPA regional staff.  FLA works through EPA Portal/Extranet authentication.  The FLA tool and registration link are located here:
